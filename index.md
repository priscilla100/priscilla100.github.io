## About Me

I am a **third-year PhD student** in Computer Science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/), advised by [Dr. Omar Chowdhury](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~omar/). My research lies at the intersection of **formal methods, natural language processing, and machine learning**, with a focus on building trustworthy AI systems through neural-symbolic reasoning.

Currently, I am developing **agentic systems for automated compliance verification** that translate natural language into formal logic (LTL, FOL) to check policy adherence across multiple regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, GLBA). My work bridges the gap between the flexibility of large language models and the precision of formal verification.

Prior to Stony Brook, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of New Brunswick under [Dr. Ali Ghorbani](https://www.unb.ca/faculty-staff/directory/computer-science/ghorbani-ali.html), where I worked on machine learning for IoT device profiling and intrusion detection.

## Research Interests

- **Formal Methods & Verification:** Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), First-Order Logic (FOL), theorem proving
- **Neural-Symbolic AI:** Bridging neural networks and symbolic reasoning for trustworthy AI
- **Natural Language Processing:** LLM-based specification synthesis and reasoning
- **AI Safety & Compliance:** Automated regulatory compliance checking (HIPAA, GDPR, SOX)
- **Agentic Systems:** Autonomous reasoning, planning, and self-correction in AI systems
