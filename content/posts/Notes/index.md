# Introduction
These are a selection of my notes of courses taught at University of Michigan. If you're interested in the $\LaTeX$ code, have a look on [Github](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Notes). 
If you're interested in my setup, also have a look on [Github](https://github.com/sleepymalc/VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape) or just [here](./VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape).

## What's in here?
All notes are written in modern style $\LaTeX$ with clear definition/theorem references and hyperlinks. Also, the drawing is done in a professional and clean way.

</p>

This is the first course toward the series of large-scale and rigorous mathematical programming graduated level courses taught by [Jon Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/jonleewebpage/). Topics include **Linear Programming**, **Weak and Strong Duality**, **Simplex Algorithm**, **Large-Scale Linear Programming**, **Sensitivity Analysis** and also **Integer Programming** and their applications.

</p>

This is a graduated level course about social network analysis taught by [Vijay G Subramanian](https://subramanian.engin.umich.edu/), covering topics across **Graph Partitioning Algorithm**, **Community Detection Algorithm**, **Stochastic Process and Markov Chain**, **Monte Carlo Algorithm**, **Random Graph Theory** and **Game Theory** with **Auctions and Matching Market**.

## Winter 2022
### Algebraic Topology (MATH592 @Umich)
<p align="center">
	<img src="./figures/MATH592.png" width="30%"/>
</p>

This is a graduated level course taught by [Jennifer Wilson](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/) about Introduction to Algebraic Topology. It is self-contained enough that only requires background about abstract algebra and some point set topology. Topics include **CW-Complex**, **Fundamental Group**, **Van-Kampen Theorem**, **Homology** and also their applications like [Lefschetz fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefschetz_fixed-point_theorem).

### Real Analysis (MATH597 @Umich)
<p align="center">
	<img src="./figures/MATH597.png" width="30%"/>
</p>

This is the graduate level Real Analysis taught by [Jinho Baik](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~baik/Welcome.html). Everything is built up from Measure Theory, like integration and differentiation. Topics include **Measure Theory**, **Hilbert/Banach Spaces**, **$L^p$ Spaces**, and some **Fourier Analysis**.
