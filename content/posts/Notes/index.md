# Note

These are the lecture notes I took, and if you're interested in the $\LaTeX$ code, have a look on [GitHub](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Notes). If you're interested in my setup, also have a look at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sleepymalc/VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape) or just [here](./VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape).

## What's in here?

All notes are written in modern style $\LaTeX$ with clear definition/theorem references and hyperlinks. Also, the drawing is done professionally and cleanly.

### Fall 2021

#### Linear Programming (MATH561/IOE510/TO518 @Umich)

<p>
	<img src="./figures/MATH561.png" align="right" width="18%"/>
</p>

This is the first course in the series of graduate-level, large-scale and rigorous mathematical programming courses taught by [Jon Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/jonleewebpage/). Topics include **Linear Programming**, **Weak and Strong Duality**, the **Simplex Algorithm**, **Large-Scale Linear Programming**, **Sensitivity Analysis**, and also **Integer Programming** and their applications.

#### Analysis of Social Networks (EECS544/EECS444 @Umich)

<p>
	<img src="./figures/EECS544.png" align="right" width="18%"/>
</p>

This is a graduate-level course about social network analysis taught by [Vijay G Subramanian](https://subramanian.engin.umich.edu/), covering topics across **Graph Partitioning Algorithm**, **Community Detection Algorithm**, **Stochastic Process and Markov Chain**, **Monte Carlo Algorithm**, **Random Graph Theory** and **Game Theory** with **Auctions and Matching Market**.

### Winter 2022

#### Algebraic Topology (MATH592 @Umich)

<p>
	<img src="./figures/MATH592.png" align="right" width="18%"/>
</p>

This is a graduate-level course taught by [Jennifer Wilson](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/) about Introduction to Algebraic Topology. It is self-contained enough that only requires a background in abstract algebra and some point set topology. Topics include **CW-Complex**, **Fundamental Group**, **Van-Kampen Theorem**, **Homology**, and also their applications like [Lefschetz fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefschetz_fixed-point_theorem).

#### Real Analysis (MATH597 @Umich)

<p>
	<img src="./figures/MATH597.png" align="right" width="18%"/>
</p>

This is the graduate-level real analysis course taught by [Jinho Baik](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~baik/Welcome.html). Everything is built up from measure theory, like integration and differentiation. Topics include **Measure Theory**, **Hilbert/Banach Spaces**, **$L^p$ Spaces**, and some **Fourier Analyses**.

### Fall 2022[^1]

[^1]: I also took Nonlinear Programming (MATH663/IOE611), but the professor provides nice lecture slides, so I won't bother scribing it myself.

#### Randomness and Computation ([EECS572](https://mahdi.ch/eecs572/) @Umich, TA)

<p>
	<img src="./figures/EECS572.png" align="right" width="18%"/>
</p>

This is the advanced graduate-level theory course focused on randomized complexity and related topics taught by [Mahdi Cheraghchi](https://mahdi.ch/), and I'm grateful to be a teaching assistant for this course together with Neophytos Charalambides. The note will be posted after the semester ends (soon!).

#### Approximation Algorithms and Hardness of Approximation (EECS598-001 @Umich)

<p>
	<img src="./figures/EECS598-001.png" align="right" width="18%"/>
</p>

This is the graduate-level algorithm course taught by [Euiwoong Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~euiwoong/), which focuses on methods of designing and analyzing approximation algorithms, together with the theoretical background on showing the hardness of approximation. Topics include **Covering**, **Clustering**, **Network Design**, and **CSP**. We also talked about **Lasserre (SoS) Hierarchy**, **Unique Game Conjecture**, and **Probabilistic Checkable Proofs**.

#### Functional Analysis (MATH602 @Umich)

<p>
	<img src="./figures/MATH602.png" align="right" width="18%"/>
</p>

This is the graduate-level functional analysis course taught by [Joseph Conlon](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~conlon/). The focus of this course is rather standard, including **Banach and Hilbert Spaces Theory**, **Bounded Linear, Compact, and Self-Adjoint Operators Theorem**, **Representation, Hahn-Banach, Open Mapping Theorem**, and **Spectral Theory**. We also covered some point-set topology along the way.
