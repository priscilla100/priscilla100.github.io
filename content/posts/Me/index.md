## The Year 2022

### Winter 2022 @UMich

#### Feb. 26

Spring break just started, and I wasted the very first day successfully, which is probably the only thing I know how to succeed at this moment. I just felt burned out at this moment, after three hard exams, piles of assignments, and the stress from my research. Not whining, but this semester is way harder than I can ever imagine...

#### Mar. 01

It turns out that in [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com), I use $\LaTeX$ the ***most***.

Not sure whether this is a good thing or not ðŸ˜…, since it somehow indicates how busy I'm writing math stuff instead of working on my research... But at least I can now say I'm the No.1 in the world lmao.[^1]

### Summer 2022 @UMich

#### Sep. 01

I think I should at least write something before the summer break ends otherwise this wonderful summer will be left blank on my website, which is just not true. In these three months, I learn much more than in the past three years of my college life: not only academically, but in all other aspects as well. I have three interesting and exciting projects that run in parallel, and although they are not quite the same, still tightly related. I hope I get time to say more about it, but this is not the right time, so wait for it!

### Fall 2022 @UMich

#### Oct. 22

Finally, I decide not to get another math degree. Not because I'm bad at math, but because of the unexpected complexity of doing a triple degree. In the past year, I learn [linear programming](../Notes/index.md#linear-programming-math561ioe510to518-umich), [measure theory](../Notes/index.md#real-analysis-math597-umich), and [algebraic topology](../Notes/index.md#algebraic-topology-math592-umich), and am currently learning [functional analysis](../Notes/index.md#functional-analysis-math602-umich) and nonlinear optimization. And if I still choose to pursue a math degree at UMich, I can't learn what I want to learn (I plan to take multi-variables complex analysis and stochastic process theory the next term) otherwise I can't graduate in the expected term, i.e., Winter 23, since I'll need to spend 12 credits on something I don't like to fulfill the degree requirement ðŸ˜¥. Hence, I make a big move: I quit! I think I should not bother myself with a meaningless degree since I have other promising *proofs* which show my math knowledge.

### Winter 2023 @Umich

### Mar. 19

It's been quite a while since the last post, and I think it's good to document what I have been up to recently. I just accepted my UIUC ðŸŒ½ Info offer, so I'll spend my next five (hope not longer than this) years there! The field I'm going to work on is going to be GMN theory, and more broadly, just DL theory. Although I think my advisor won't mind me doing some cool TCS stuff along the way ðŸ˜‡ Let's see how it goes.

Additionally, this is my last semester at UMich, and after that, I'm going back to Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ and spending four months there with my family and friends while finishing the last semester of my dual degree at SJTU online. Hope everything works out, I really need a good rest.
