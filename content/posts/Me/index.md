# Me

I'm just a regular student who is stressed and can't fall asleep every night. I have lots to say to this world, but no one is listening, not because people intended ignoring me, just because I'm not that important, and we all understand that.

## The Year 2022

### Winter 2022 @UMich

#### Feb. 26

The spring breaks just started, and I wasted the very first day successfully, which is probably the only thing I know how to succeed at this moment. I just felt burned out at this moment, after three hard exams, piles of assignments, and the stress from my research. Not whining, but this semester is way harder than I can ever imagine...

#### Mar. 01

It turns out that in [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com), I use $\LaTeX$ the ***most***.

Not sure whether this is a good thing or notðŸ˜…, since it somehow indicates how busy I'm writing math stuff instead of working on my research... But at least I can now say I'm the No.1 in the world lmao.[^1]

### Summer 2022 @UMich

#### Sep. 01

I think I should at least write something before the summer break ends otherwise this wonderful summer will be left blank in my website, which is just not true. In this three months, I learn much more than the past three years in my college life: not only academically, but all other aspects as well. I have three interesting and exciting projects run in parallel, and although they are not quite the same, but still tightly related. I hope I get time to say more about it, but this is not the right time, so wait for it!

### Fall 2022 @UMich

#### Oct. 22

Finally, I decide not to get another math degree. Not because I'm bad at math, but because of the unexpected complexity of doing a triple-degree. In the past year, I learn [linear programming](../Notes/index.md#linear-programming-math561ioe510to518-umich), [measure theory](../Notes/index.md#real-analysis-math597-umich), [algebraic topology](../Notes/index.md#algebraic-topology-math592-umich), and are currently learning [functional analysis](../Notes/index.md#functional-analysis-math602-umich) and nonlinear optimization. And if I still choose to purse a math degree at UMich, I can't learn what I want to learn (I plan to take multi-variables complex analysis and stochastic process theory the next term) otherwise I can't graduate in the expected term, i.e., Winter 23, since I'll need to spend 12 credits on something I don't really like to fulfill the degree requirement ðŸ˜¥. Hence, I make a big move: I quit! I think I should not bother myself with a meaningless degree since I have other promising *proofs* which shows my math knowledge.
