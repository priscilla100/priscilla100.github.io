Though I'm quite satisfied to show my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/sleepymalc), it turns out that I have much more want to show. For example, GitHub is extremely unfriendly to show `.pdf` files since the internal link (we call it *hyperlink* for those $\LaTeX$ geeks) doesn't work. This kind 
of problem arises quite often. Besides, my only hobby these days is *photographing*, and as you may already know, no one will show their photos on GitHub!

Apart from all these, since I use $\LaTeX$ a **LOT** (yup, I'm one of those $\LaTeX$ Freaks), and the only way I know how to render $\LaTeX$ formula on GitHub is *ugly*, and it can only render fixed color texts, hence this make me made my mind eventually.
