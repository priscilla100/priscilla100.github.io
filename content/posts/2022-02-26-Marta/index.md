# Introduction
I have been using macOS for a straight 4 years now, though most of the design choices made by excellent Apple engineers are easy to use, and even if it's not the case, there are at least some alternatives. But Finder is different.
I asked lots of my macOS friends, and nearly all of them think Finder is fine, "it's fast and easy to use."

Every time I heard about this, I doubt they haven't seen [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) before. Though I can certainly write another paragraph introducing [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) to you
But sadly, Apple already moved to M1 chips, and [Totalfinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) is just too old to be compatible with this new chip architecture. After some surfing, I found another alternative, [Marta](https://marta.sh/).

# ðŸ¦Š Marta - A Finder ðŸ¦Š
As a developer and hardcore mathematician, I barely use pen and paper to write stuff, even if doing math. (Yes, this means I typeset my course note in $\LaTeX$ also, check [here](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Notes)) And 
to be efficient enough, I hate moving my hand off my keyboard, including using a Trackpad or mouse. You may ask, "Ok, so what? You can use arrow keys moving around in Finder too!" Well, this is true, in some sense. If 
you only use Finder to navigate around your files, then it may be sufficient for your usage. But if you need to open multiple tabs and want to access them quickly, then Finder is **not** the way to go for sure. It's extremely 
slow to open multiple windows and let it float around your workspace and try to use a mouse/Trackpad to drag files around. Instead, I would like to do all these in a single window in a well-organized manner.
