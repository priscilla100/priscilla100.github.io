## Introduction

Do you think typing fast, i.e., achieving a high wpm (high word-per-minutes), is the only way to be efficient/productive? If you do, then this compact, 5-mins read post will blow your mind, making you *even faster*.[^1]

[^1]: In the sense of efficiency, go without saying.

### Mentality

What I'm going to share is not about how you can be fast in regular typesetting, e.g., achieving wpm 150 in [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com). Rather, it's about some of the most fundamental editing-related key remaps I have done.

>If you have read the post about [VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape](../VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape) and are still wondering how I can typeset these [notes](../Notes) in class, here it is: this is my only secret left.

Before walking through my key remaps one by one, I want to give you the mentality you should have when adapting my settings: Your hands should move **as little as possible**. You might already hear this multiple times, but you should bring this to an **extreme**, i.e., staying your hand on the main row (i.e., right index finger on `f`, left index finger on `j`) is the *bare minimum* you should achieve.

Let me ask you: *How do you typically delete a character?* If you use `delete` (`backspace`) with your right little finger traveling across 2 columns and 2 rows, then you should keep reading.

### Tool matters

First thing first, please get yourself a good keyboard. I use [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com/) Professional Hybrid Type-S personally. It's fast, elegant, and customizable. Moreover, the revolutionary layout is awesome.[^2]

### The Setup

I will use macOS and [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) as our working example, but the same concept should be easily ported to other operating systems. The following is a snapshot of my setting.

You can easily import these settings [at the end](#import-settings), which can be used as your own setting's starting point. Now, let's walk through them one by one.
