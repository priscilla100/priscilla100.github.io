## Introduction

I have been optimizing my typesetting skill since my first Bachelor year, and four years later, I think I can share something interesting with you to help you type *even faster*. What I'm going to share is not about how you can be fast in regular typesetting, but rather, I want to share some of my keyboard settings (i.e., key re-map) which opens up a new world for typesetting (at least to me).
