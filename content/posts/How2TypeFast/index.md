## Introduction

I have been optimizing my typesetting skill since my first Bachelor year, and four years later, I think I can share something interesting with you to help you type *even faster*. What I'm going to share is not about how you can be fast in regular typesetting, e.g., achieving wpm 150 in [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com); rather, I want to share some of my keyboard settings (i.e., key remaps), which opens up a new world for typesetting.

> First thing first, please get yourself a good keyboard. I use [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com/) Professional Hybrid Type-S personally. It's fast, elegant, and customizable.[^1]

## Mentality

Before walking through my key remaps one by one, I want to give you the mentality you should have when adapting my settings: Your hand should move ***at less at possible***.

You might already hear this multiple times, but you should bring this to an extreme. For example, staying your hand on the main row (i.e., right index finger on `f`, left index finger on `j`) is the *bare minimum* you should achieve. Let me ask you: how do you typically delete a character? Do you use `delete` (`backspace`) with your right little finger traveling across 2 columns and 2 rows? If the answer is yes, then you should keep reading.
