## Introduction

I have been optimizing my typesetting skill since my first Bachelor year, and four years later, I think I can share something interesting with you to help you type *even faster*.

### Mentality

What I'm going to share is not about how you can be fast in regular typesetting, e.g., achieving wpm 150 in [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com). Rather, it's about some of the most fundamental editing-related key remaps I have done.

> If you have read the post about [VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape](./VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape) and are still wondering how I can typeset these [notes](./Notes) in class, here it is: this is my only secret left.

Before walking through my key remaps one by one, I want to give you the mentality you should have when adapting my settings: Your hands should move **as little as possible**. You might already hear this multiple times, but you should bring this to an **extreme**, i.e., staying your hand on the main row (i.e., right index finger on `f`, left index finger on `j`) is the *bare minimum* you should achieve.

Let me ask you: *How do you typically delete a character?* If you

<p style="text-align: center;"> use <code>delete</code> (<code>backspace</code>) with your right little finger traveling across 2 columns and 2 rows, </p>

then you should keep reading.

### Tool matters

First thing first, please get yourself a good keyboard. I use [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com/) Professional Hybrid Type-S personally. It's fast, elegant, and customizable.[^1]

## Arrow Keys

I will use macOS as the working example, but the same concept should be easily ported to other operating systems.

## Math-Related Characters

## Escape, Left and Right Shift
