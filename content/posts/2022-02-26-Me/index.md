excerpt: I'm just a regular student who is stressed and can't fall asleep every night. I have lots to say to this world, but no one is listening, not because people intended ignoring me, just because I'm not that important, and we all understand that. So, I decided to create this post to spit out some random nonsense, which shall make me feel a little bit better.

# Feb. 26, 2022. 
The spring breaks just started, and I wasted the very first day successfully, which is probably the only thing I know how to succeed at this moment. I just felt burned out at this moment, after three hard exams, piles of assignments, and the stress from my research.
Not whining, but this semester is way harder than I can ever imagine...
