# Abstract
I'm just a regular student who is stressed and can't fall asleep every night. I have lots to say to this world, but no one is listening, not because people intended ignoring me, just because I'm not that important, and we all understand that. 

# The Year 2022.
## Feb. 26. 
The spring breaks just started, and I wasted the very first day successfully, which is probably the only thing I know how to succeed at this moment. I just felt burned out at this moment, after three hard exams, piles of assignments, and the stress from my research.
Not whining, but this semester is way harder than I can ever imagine...

## Mar. 01.
It turns out that in [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com), I use $\LaTeX$ the ***most***.

Not sure whether this is a good thing or notðŸ˜…, since it somehow indicates how busy I'm writing math stuff instead of working on my research... But at least 
I can now say I'm the No.1 in the world lmao.
