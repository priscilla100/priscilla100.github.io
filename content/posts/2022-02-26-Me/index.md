excerpt: Here are my configurations about my m1 MacBook pro (m1 pro chip version). Lots of them work out of the box, but some of them need some tweaking. I consider myself a hard-core macOS user my laptop is running more than 20 small plug-in styles apps constantly, so it may be hard to debug sometimes. But be patient, it is really worth the effort!

# Introduction
I'll divide paragraphs into two categories:
1. General
2. Technical
Since some apps are very domain-specific, hence it's not that useful for some (ok, most) of you. Let's start!

## General
### App Cleaner & Uninstaller

[App Cleaner & Uninstaller](https://nektony.com/mac-app-cleaner), as the name suggests, I don't think I have much to say about this app, since it's quite self-explanatory. It's sometimes easier to delete something from an app rather than manually do it yourself, since it introduces some uncertainty like remaining files and so on, which is handled well in this app.

### Alfred 4

I use [Alfred 4](https://www.alfredapp.com/) mainly for two things: 

1. Open app by typing. 
> This is done by simply querying at the pop-up box of Alfred. 
2. Open app by short-cut.
