## Introduction

Despite the fast-paced development of the *machine unlearning* community, the evaluation of the performance of machine unlearning algorithms remains a big open problem due to the lack of a unified framework and rigorous justification. In this work, we theoretically formalized the *unlearning sample inference game* for provable and reliable empirical evaluation of machine unlearning algorithms, tackling one of the most foundational problems in this field.
