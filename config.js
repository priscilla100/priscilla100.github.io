  introduction: [
    'Hi there üëã! My Chinese name is **ËÉ°Âπ≥ÈÇ¶** (pronounced as *Hu, PingÀä-BongÀâ* ) from Taiwan üáπüáº, but I\'ll respond to both **Benson** and **Pingbang**, just choose one you like üëÄ (I know my Chinese name is hard to pronounce in particular üò•)',
    'I\'m a Bachelor student major in **Computer Science** and **Honor Mathematics** in *University of Michigan (UMich)* üá∫üá∏ and **Electrical Computer Engineering** in *Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)* üá®üá≥. My research interest is about *provable modern machine learning theory* and also *computational complexity* and the crossover between *graph theory*.',
    'Despite my current research topics, my interest spreads widely among topics in theoretical computer science and mathematics. For TCS in particular, I\'m interested in approximation, online and randomized algorithm üß†; as for math, I\'m quite into random matrix theory, statistic, differential and algebraic topology and functional analysis recently üìö.',
    'Occasionally, I\'ll do street photography üì∑ and write blog posts ‚úçÔ∏è as a hobby, check out my personal [account](https://www.instagram.com/malc_ph/) and my [blog posts](./posts) üìù! I also love playing drums ü•Å and are now learning guitar üé∏.',
